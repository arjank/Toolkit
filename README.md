Toolkit
=======

This repo contains some useful tools that help to make my life easier.

One of the reasosn I started creating these tools is that mysqldump output files are not useful if you want to copy a database dump to another server. This is even more true if you need to copy views and routines, since they include a definer and that same definer is not always available as a user on the remote machine.
